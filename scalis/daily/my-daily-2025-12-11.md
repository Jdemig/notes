## Issues Worked On

- Looked into chrome extension showing blank
- Reviewed Alexandr Cosovs pull request for chrome extension
- Worked on interview kit page with Alexander, David and Andrei
    - Workout out the business logic that we needed to follow
    - Update the interview kit page so that it does not need a scorecard to display to the user - it will show them that they need to contact an admin to get a scorecard
    - Update default interview message to be consistent
    

### Canceled

- **S24-9614** We Need To Grey Out The Interview Kit Token If No Scorecard Template Is Made

### Todo

- **S24-9613** Email Template Page & Document Template Page Hide Most Tokens
- **S24-9612** Email Drawer Doesn't Show Selected Template But Instead Shows Default
