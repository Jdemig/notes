## Issues Worked On

- Worked on email sending logic PR - cleaned up tests - created some tests - added this function to two location in manual schedule interview flow and tested
- Did this so that the email records work that needs to be done will be straightforward and wont require any more rewrites

### Todo

- **S25-9775** Interview Confirmation email for interview loop contains time in incorrect timezone

  - Candidate profile seems to contain time in correct timezone (the one selected in interview schedule form)
  - Email contains time in GMT+0
