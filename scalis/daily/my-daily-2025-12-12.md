## Issues Worked On

### Canceled

- **S24-9612** Email Drawer Doesn't Show Selected Template But Instead Shows Default
  - Unable to reproduce

### Done

- **S24-9642** Upgrade React & NextJS to fix React2Shell
- **S24-9641** Fix Manual Schedule Email Sending Bugs
  - Fix bug with interview kit token not being replaced
  - Fix bug with email being sent to candidate instead of the interviewer
- **S24-9629** Disable Graphiql In Deployed Environments

### In Review

- **S24-9633** Rework Email Sending Logic to Reduce Complexity
  - Currently very difficult to read
  - Has too many side effects
  - Not clear what should happen when
  - Uses tokenContext to handle email sending logic - should not do this
- **S24-9628** Work On Release Pipeline Process
  - We need a better QA process. Plan is to build an automatic system to notify QA of what was released to staging so that they can test it thoroughly before production release.

### Todo

- **S24-9515** Advance Candidate email doesn't have "Contact Employer" button

  - This email had this button before email redesign. It should be a mailto link:
