## Issues Worked On

### In Progress

- **S25-9670** Look Into Email Notification That Interviewer Received In Wrong Time Zone
  - Use "Manual Schedule" flow
  - Create interview
  - See if an email that goes to interviewer has the incorrect time zone
  - Might as well check other times zones while at it
  - * Document and give to developer
  - @alexandr.cosov I think @cleber.andreazza looked into this and couldn't reproduce
- **S25-9690** Fix Custom Application & Profile Tokens

### Done

- **S25-9688** Fix Flakey e2e Test In Email Templates

### Ready for QA

- **S25-9677** Custom Offer Tokens Not Replaced
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-17 at 7.59.38 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/7b39feeb-e1d2-41b0-8442-1801585bff7e/070208df-b747-4049-8032-fdec2ce12b7e)
  - Fix a bug with non system token causing unique constraint violation error because it was empty string instead of null for the systemTokeValue
  - Hide custom tokens that can not be populated given the context
  - Only add copy text chip in custom field tokens table if is a system token
  - Add cursor pointer to copy text chip
  - Added more detail on if a token is a system token and add a placeholder backup

### Todo

- **S25-9681** Make Dummy Values That Are Replaced In Email Preview More Intuitive
  - We have received customer complaints that they are confused why some email preview values are dummy - for example the interview summary is a dummy value when scheduling an interview - we have some of the real values but not all of them
  - To solve this we may want to highlight some dummy values in blue? With a tooltip?
  - Instead of replacing with dummy values just replace with token
- **S25-9682** Add Back CC & BCC To Send Email (And Maybe Other Drawers?)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-17 at 12.11.36 PM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/deae5821-d102-4430-9e9f-0008d9fc18d5/4f847fdc-d841-4b7e-aa82-c408e3900040)
- **S25-9676** Interview Token Replacement Issues candidateInterviewId not Passed
