## Issues Worked On

### Done

- **S24-9072** Create email preview component for rendering email templates
  - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/NyR2VqK3HGOsK0cQ6yMycB/Settings----Email-Templates?node-id=2093-2757&m=dev) (in progress)
  - Some of the work will involve trying to get the email templates to render in the web correctly. It's important that we can get them to appear that same way in both web and email. So, before we get the preview you could start by creating a email preview component that can take our email templates.
  - Updated template seeding — Switched to new default templates for seeding
  - Fixed email formatting — Set plainText to true for proper text rendering
  - Fixed edit functionality — Resolved issues with edit operations
  - Fixed type checks and unit tests — Resolved type checking and unit test failures
  - Restored calendar settings check — Re-added calendar settings validation
  - Fixed token context — Passed token context so replacement information is correct
  - Fixed manual schedule flow — Ensured the send message step works in the manual schedule flow
  - Merged main branch — Merged latest changes from main into the email preview feature branch
  - Fixed comments from Andrei - all caps bug on tooltip
- **S24-9459** Look Into Client Facing API
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 7.58.05 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/a6673c01-67d4-4d7a-a4c1-351fc771378d/bfdb6778-6539-4aed-aba1-f9c3a6ea380e)
  - Josiah is going to build this under /api-docs with magidoc
  - Look into update our Roles to allow for API USER role
- **S24-9270** Send Offer Letter Email Template is incorrect
  - [offer.mp4](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/2b82c4b0-c7e4-4b4e-b61f-d57b45116d91/7185fd2b-3a70-4cc9-86e0-7dda11d33ee6)
  - Looked into this. Found issues with the way offer templates were setup. There was no offer template for the PDF document. This needed to come from document templates. Added that in. Also added in templates to the email send logic. That was necessary.
