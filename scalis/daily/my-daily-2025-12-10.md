## Issues Worked On

### In Progress

- **S24-9597** Offer Letter Needs an Esignature Email Message Type
  - Fix a bug with email not found
  - Fix a bug with wrong message type
  - Found bugs with token replacement - many strategies need to sort by descending so we get the latest CandidateOffer
  - Update the use case so that we send the dynamic email - before this we were still appending the message to offer letter emails

### Done

- **S24-9604** Move Over Prisma Migrate Rollback Generate Script to Use Prisma Diff
  - This is a more reliable way to generate rollback scripts when checking out branches
- **S24-9594** Interview Kit Link On Scorecard is Broken
  - Ended up fixing this broke link
  - Also fixed many type issues
  - * Fixed poor structure inside of the scorecard-grid - should be using the showModal() instead of using setState
