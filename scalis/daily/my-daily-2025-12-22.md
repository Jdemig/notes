## Issues Worked On

### Todo

- **S25-9681** Make Dummy Values That Are Replaced In Email Preview More Intuitive
  - We have received customer complaints that they are confused why some email preview values are dummy - for example the interview summary is a dummy value when scheduling an interview - we have some of the real values but not all of them
  - To solve this we may want to highlight some dummy values in blue? With a tooltip?
  - Default to using the blue highlighted token instead of a dummy value. The only one that may need to be a dummy value is the INTERVIEW_SUMMARY token. The INTERVIEW_SUMMARY is important and we don't want them to remove it. However, ideally we should update the email template to use the interview summary component instead so that the interview information is not optional when sending out an interview. I think we should create a "footer" parameter for the ScalisDynamicEmail or something that allows us to place components at the bottom of the email.
- **S25-9743** Implement Karolina’s Mockups For Ratings In Pipeline
