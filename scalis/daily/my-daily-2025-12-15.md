## Issues Worked On

### Done

- **S24-9654** Other Company Users Cannot Update The Candidate Rating
  - This is because we are creating new ratings for each company user when we should update the same rating
  - Alternatively we should have UI to handle multiple ratings - this can be a separate ticket
- **S24-9647** Add Another Decimal to Scorecard Overall Score

### In Review

- **S24-9653** Prevent Scheduling Interviews In The Past
  - Throw a toast notification letting them know that they can't. Or maybe better would be form validation. So the input is just invalid. Also, scroll to invalid inputs is important.
  - So this should be invalid
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-15 at 12.58.22 PM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/7d8cea76-8139-4f37-b681-65e6c9c64738/e0beae45-f27c-4b2f-a4b2-cab9a5ede0f8)
  - If we don't do this validation then the clients will get this error (very confusing - does not indicate what actually went wrong here)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-15 at 12.59.38 PM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/bddab4b4-1d94-4028-ae23-fc0d663c09fd/e1beaa9d-8e55-4d8c-b03b-d36ac4f78fef)
  - Urgent because I ran into this bug with Sean Podnar at RedcanAI
- **S24-9628** Work On Release Pipeline Process
  - We need a better QA process. Plan is to build an automatic system to notify QA of what was released to staging so that they can test it thoroughly before production release.
  - Auto create tickets for QA to test these items

### Todo

- **S24-9652** Organizer Calendar Bug - Should Not Have Two Options In Dropdown
  - Investigate how this happened. I'm guessing that he connected his calendar twice and when he disconnected one of them it did not fully disconnect.
  - Here you can see the two options with Sean Podnar. I know that they are different emails if you look at the database.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-15 at 12.32.59 PM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/24b8aea8-bce9-4411-aa77-6ea01e7eb19f/792e2d5e-1aab-429a-8263-cf13681a2265)
  - And if you look at user management you will see that Sean only has one account. So it should not be possible for him to have two emails connected.
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-15 at 12.34.12 PM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/7c783567-d53e-4cca-8ec1-5293bcc3453f/6b3c2de0-dcf3-424a-84e9-0ba445ea2d7c)
  - Not a bug but we should show the email address to distinguish between the two. Not a bug because we automatically connect shared calendars
- **S24-9438** Add new option to select meeting host (separate from calendar) when using Zoom for conferencing
  - We need another drop-down and option to select which user's Zoom grantId should be used when scheduling a video meeting with Zoom.
  - Check w Parker
- **S24-9644** Try To Reproduce Chrome Extension Bug
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 11.19.28 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/b5fdcdc4-6aaa-40d6-9b64-acd4d28b1ec5/2e032a88-14e3-490e-a39d-a851a3effb51)
  - * Happens all the time (no profile or situation will allow content to populate in the profile)
  - Let me know if you can reproduce
- **S24-9515** Advance Candidate email doesn't have "Contact Employer" button
  - ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/b7ef19c3-0347-4570-872a-669e14e72ed3/b5272754-5def-40eb-a973-be0677113135)
  - This email had this button before email redesign. It should be a mailto link:
  - ![image.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/357fa00a-1620-4896-b1ef-c22cc811e8e8/38ee4a90-13ff-485b-b8a0-3995a80a49ca)
  - Should be pretty easy - just add in the callToAction param
- **S24-9648** Rework Emails Section - The Email Section Does Not Contain All Emails Sent out
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-15 at 10.11.58 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/292e6e43-f4d5-41ac-b9b3-71ce2f1d9718/bf677133-6767-4afd-92bf-e6566ad5b0ee)
- **S24-9639** Fix Chrome Extension No Content Bug from CoAdvantage
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 11.25.15 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/1ee7ecdb-0df9-4c5a-9e8c-600f44ff054c/f72b664e-9f8d-4fe5-b1d7-033206b86e02)
  - ![Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 11.19.28 AM.png](https://uploads.linear.app/aab1fec4-32a0-4893-ae74-f25344022c52/fdd85a0c-c6db-404d-b098-34fcd4d37643/e2130174-89ff-4961-9ba6-20112a5e5733)
  - Happens on Chrome and Edge
  - Happens on all LinkedIn profiles
  - There were no cases where we were able to get any content to appear
- **S24-9638** Reach Out To Sean Podner @ RedcanAI And Walk Him Through Bug Fixes
  - Hop on a call - have him go through all the changes
  - Fix any other bugs that pop up
