# Stakeholder Priorities – November 2025

## Security (Parker)
- Enforce Google Sign-In for all workspace users.
- Require two-factor authentication for workspace access.
- Treat as immediate priority; unblock enterprise engagements and risk compliance concerns.

## Circle Meeting Notes
- Split multi-location job listings in the XML feed into separate records per location to avoid location ambiguity.
- Provide a standardized Google Calendar invite template for interviews/meetings.

## ISC Meeting Notes
- Notifications
  - Surface scorecards that are overdue or incomplete.
  - Notify teammates when an applicant is advanced (with per-user controls for who receives the alert and by channel: email vs in-app).
  - Support Slack notifications for pipeline activity.
- Customization
  - Allow customizing email subjects (feature already exists but needs visibility/UX refinement).
  - Allow customizing calendar invite subjects.
- Interview Scheduling
  - Let coordinators manually input interview date/time details within the platform.
- Permissions
  - Expand permission granularity for who can perform actions or view candidate stages.
- Resume Viewer UX
  - Adjust default zoom (200% feels small); explore better defaults or remember user preferences.

## Couchsurfing Meeting
- Improve duplicate detection and removal for job listings.
