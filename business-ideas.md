Business Ideas
- Test idea
- A place people can report scammer information so that we can track them down and report them to the police. Could build automated tools for piecing together reports and information to narrow down who they are
- All chrome extensions out there to create a distraction free website (for example there are extensions individual for LinkedIn, Reddit, etc) suck. We should build an all in one service that removes distractions from all websites you could want all in one place. I think you could get away with charging a small monthly fee if you had everything in one place and it worked really well. Obviously you’re competing with free options so it’ll have to deliver more value. You could also build tools for mobile devices as well to reduce distractions. Chrome extensions don’t work on mobile yet the phone is incredibly distracting.
- Create a decentralized anti corruption fund. I think a lot of the issues today stem from people in charge paying money to other people to vet them. Like politicians donating have someone trying to make sure there is transparency but those people are paid by the politicians. I think it may be interesting if the people funded an anti corruption anti waste part of the government that should be independent of bias because it’s paid for directly by the people? Although I suppose anyone could donate and maybe it could become corrupt by large donors influencing the employees too? Either way it would be interesting to see some decentralized entity getting paid to uncover corruption.
- Venmo does not offer a public API for sending or requesting payments, and their terms of service prohibit automating interactions with their platform. It’s not possible to build an app that automatically sends Venmo requests or charges someone without user interaction. However, it is possible to build a legal and secure app that connects to a user’s credit card or bank account using services like Plaid, Finicity, or MX to read transaction data. The app could identify shared expenses (e.g., Hulu, DoorDash) based on merchant name or category and then generate a Venmo request URL. The user would still have to approve and send the request manually through the Venmo app. — While full automation is not possible with Venmo, you can still streamline the process. For auto-charging or billing, Stripe Subscriptions or PayPal Billing Agreements are better suited. These allow you to store a payment method and automatically bill it on a recurring basis. You could build an app that uses Plaid to track expenses and Stripe to charge someone automatically for their share, especially useful for business partners or shared expenses where recurring billing is expected. — In short, you can’t auto-charge through Venmo, but you can build a tool that tracks shared expenses and facilitates near-automatic Venmo requests. For true automation, integrate Plaid for transaction tracking and Stripe for payment collection.
- Open source insurance. Write an algorithm / website that insures people. People pay into the smart contract. The smart contract pays out when a user makes a claim. But, other users have to approve the claim. It’s decentralized because anyone that has insurance with the decentralized platform can approve claims. If you approve claims you get to make a bit of money from the platform. Because it’s decentralized i belive it would lower insurance costs. There is no profit going to the top. It’s just a bunch of people either approving or rejecting claims. You need at least 3 people to have a looked at a claim. The claim needs photos etc. Those can be hosted on AWS and the rest on the blockchain. You 
- A gambling DAO. A decentralized way to distribute gambling wins to the owners of the DAO. No longer does the house always win. The people always win. I like the idea of if people are going to gamble at least the owners of the DAO (random people) get to win too. Sort of like a healthier gambling addiction
- Smart contract betting - two parties put money into the pot. at some later date if the pot gets 2 out of 3 signatures it pays out. so you can have sort of a trustless way to place bets
- Some sort of process that proves you aren’t using AI. Could be screenshots uploaded to blockchain
- Garbage sorting machine that uses AI
- Test someones DNA and blood to automatically create them a custom multivitamin that will combat all their deficiencies 
- Create website that converts mpr files to csv
- Build a giveaway website builder that handles all the logistics and legal concerns for the user. Its also important for trust. We would be the third party that ensures the giveaway is legitimate. Our clients would need to purchase the giveaway up front and then we handle the rest
- Build. way to track your earnings across crypto investments. Fidelity does a good job of tax compliance and you could build a crypto tool for tax compliance 
- Try to solve the problem of food waste by shipping exact quantities of food. Like hello fresh but more in bunk to kitchens
- Create a private messaging app like whatsapp but it functions like the private onion router so it’s actually private 
- Ai to read videos and translate it. Or it could summarize the video. The video could be played in a different tab so that it can quickly be summarized 
- A decentralized website? A whole website thats on a blockchain?
- Decentralized voting. I’ve been wanting to create a decentralized political structure. A system that allows people to vote online and elect officials. It would need to be self governing so that people could vote to change the system if it isn’t working for one reason or another. Also self balancing in there are power imbalances?
- Track legislation in an easy to follow way. Put all local and state legislation in one place and organize it by performance / activity. Allow people to have conversations around it

- Use GPT-3 to fill out forms - tired of filling in my name and email every damn time. It would be easy to have something like the AI that did GitHub CoPilot just fill out forms for you
- There really isn’t much incentive to post how you solved various tech issues online. Tbh I’m surprised so many people take the time out of their day to help others. So the solution would be to pay people who post their solutions online. If you solve a tech issue you can upload how you solved it step by step and get a few cents for every view your sulution gets or upvote or something like that
- Create software and maybe hardware too for logging your entire life. Couldn’t find many businesses that do this. You could snap a photo once every couple seconds. It could be low resolution. You could record audio all day long and send it to the cloud. There are audio recorders but they arent smart. There needs to be a way to record audio. Basically just press a button and it just logs everything. And then you can later search through all the audio logs with audio to text search and find things that were said. You can create optimizations where quiet moments dont get recorded.
- Omegle / Tinder mix where people can swipe between video feeds of users. It’ll be better than omegle because you can filter by age and have a bio. But it’ll be way better than tinder because people are forced to talk to you at least for a second or two
- Create a solution for the problem of giving your employees login credentials. For example I could give an employee my email and password but then they cant reset the email. Or I could give them their own email but then I cant log in. There needs to be a permissions management solution to all a users logins at a given company. Something that will allows the CEO to get access to everything one of his employees has touched. And it needs to be super easy.
- Use ethereum to slowly pay someone in the event of a death or something - like an eth trust fund - a trust less trust fund
- An economic simulator. The first goal would be to simulate what happens when minimum wage rises. I feel like you could do this pretty easily with a bunch of people models that have bank accounts and then properties like where they get paid from (their job) and where money goes to every month. You can generate more people and then run simulate and it’ll do some automatic stuff to get them connected
- Unionsmarch.com would be an app to help unions form and organize
